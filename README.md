# Balan Platform Whitepaper

## Balancing Opportunity: A Fair Token Launch Ecosystem

**Date**: March 01, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Website**: [TBD]  
**GitHub**: [github.com/alphaWeGo/balan_platform](https://github.com/alphaWeGo/balan_platform)

### 1. Introduction

The cryptocurrency landscape thrives on innovation, yet fairness remains a persistent challenge—early adopters and insiders often dominate token distributions, leaving others behind. **Balan**, a shorthand for "Balance," emerges to redefine this dynamic. Built on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and inspired by Binance founder CZ’s vision of equitable tokenomics, Balan is a decentralized token launch platform designed to ensure fair access, transparent mechanics, and sustainable growth for all.

Our mission is clear: to create a balanced ecosystem where token launches prioritize fairness, empower communities, and foster long-term value. Whether you’re a project founder seeking a reliable launchpad or an investor chasing equitable opportunities, Balan is your gateway to a fairer DeFi.

### 2. The Vision of Fairness

#### Why Balan?

“Balan” stands for **Balance**, encapsulating our commitment to fairness in a market often swayed by speculative pumps and whale-driven dumps. Drawing from CZ’s tokenomics proposal ([X](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1895837657613078574)), Balan introduces a structured approach:
- **Limited Initial Supply**: Only 10% of tokens are released at launch, curbing concentration.
- **Locked Reserves**: 90% of supply is secured, unlocking gradually based on performance.
- **Equitable Access**: A fair inner pool balances opportunities across all participants.

Balan is more than a platform—it’s a pledge to make fairness the cornerstone of token launches.

### 3. Key Features

#### 3.1 Fair Tokenomics
- **Initial Allocation**: 10% of the total supply is released at launch, minted for the inner pool or community distribution, ensuring controlled circulation.
- **Locked Mechanism**: 90% of tokens are locked via smart contract, adhering to:
  - Unlocks every 6 months, capped at 5% per cycle.
  - Requires the token price to sustain 2x the previous unlock price for 30 consecutive days.
  - Projects can delay or reduce unlocks for market stability.
- **Fairness Highlight**: This prevents early dumps and aligns project incentives with community growth.

#### 3.2 Inner Pool Mechanism: The Cornerstone of Fair Access
The inner pool is Balan’s heartbeat, designed to ensure equitable participation through a dynamic pricing model:
- **Exponential Price Curve**: Starts low (e.g., 1 BNB = 1000 tokens), with prices rising exponentially as purchases increase (doubling every 10% sold). This rewards early adopters while curbing whale dominance through high costs.
- **Time-Based Adjustment**: If no trades occur for 5 minutes, the price drops to 90% of the previous 5-minute price, with a floor at 90% of the initial price (e.g., 900 tokens/BNB if initial is 1000). This balances early and late entrants.
- **Automated Liquidity**: Once the 100,000-token pool sells out, 50% (50,000 tokens) and all collected BNB are injected into PancakeSwap, ensuring immediate tradability.
- **Fairness in Action**: Early participants gain from low entry prices, latecomers benefit from time-based reductions, and whales face cost barriers—all while maintaining a price floor to protect value.

#### 3.3 Decentralized and Transparent
- **BNB Smart Chain**: Low fees and high throughput make participation accessible.
- **Modular Design**: Abstracted contracts (e.g., `LaunchToken`, `InnerPool`) enable future enhancements.
- **Third-Party Oversight**: Admin keys can be assigned to trusted entities (e.g., YZiLabs), ensuring impartiality.

### 4. Technical Architecture

#### 4.1 Smart Contract Overview
Balan’s backend comprises Solidity contracts on BSC, built for modularity and fairness:
- **LaunchPlatform**: Orchestrates token deployment and module integration.
- **LaunchToken**: ERC-20 token with 10% initial supply and 90% locked.
- **TokenLock**: Enforces CZ’s rules—5% unlocks every 6 months with a 2x price condition.
- **InnerPool**: Manages sales with dynamic pricing and liquidity triggers.
- **PancakeLiquidity**: Integrates with PancakeSwap for post-launch liquidity.

#### 4.2 Workflow
1. **Token Deployment**: Projects launch via `LaunchPlatform`, minting 1 million tokens (10% initial, 90% locked).
2. **Inner Pool Sale**: 100,000 tokens sold with an exponential curve and time-adjusted pricing.
3. **Liquidity Injection**: Upon sell-out, 50,000 tokens and all BNB pair on PancakeSwap.
4. **Locked Release**: 90% supply unlocks fairly over time.

#### 4.3 Fairness Through Technology
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Limits whale control with rising costs.
- **Time Balance**: Adjusts prices to favor broader participation.
- **Transparency**: Open-source on GitHub (`github.com/alphaWeGo/balan_platform`).

### 5. How Balan Embodies Fairness

Balan’s fairness is woven into its fabric, ensuring an even playing field:
- **Anti-Whale Protection**: The exponential price curve deters large-scale domination, preserving opportunities for smaller investors.
- **Time Equity**: Price reductions after 5-minute inactivity (with a 90% floor) provide latecomers a fair shot without devaluing early stakes.
- **Locked Commitment**: 90% supply locked with performance-based unlocks prevents premature sell-offs, aligning project and community interests.
- **Automated Transparency**: Liquidity addition is instant and impartial, ensuring open access post-launch.
- **Community Focus**: Funds fuel development and growth, tying success to collective prosperity.

Balan isn’t just a tool—it’s a guardian of equity in DeFi.

### 6. Tokenomics Example

For a Balan-launched token:
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 BALAN.
- **Initial Supply**: 100,000 (10%).
- **Locked Supply**: 900,000 (90%).
- **Inner Pool**:
  - Start: 1 BNB = 1000 BALAN.
  - 10% Sold: 1 BNB = 2000 BALAN.
  - 5 Minutes Idle: Drops to 1800 BALAN/BNB, floor at 900 BALAN/BNB.
- **Liquidity**: 50,000 BALAN + BNB to PancakeSwap.
- **Unlocks**: 50,000 every 6 months if price doubles.
